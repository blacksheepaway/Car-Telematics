# Car Telematics App

Welcome to the Car Telematics App project! This application provides a professional and intuitive interface to access real-time car telematics data. Built using Django, Django REST Framework, and Python, this project showcases your proficiency in web frameworks, APIs, and front-end technologies.

## How It Works

The Car Telematics App allows users to manage and analyze car telematics data seamlessly. Users can access a comprehensive dashboard that visually represents various parameters such as speed, RPM, fuel level, and temperature. Additionally, the app provides an API to retrieve car telematics data programmatically.

## Technologies and Techniques

- **Django**: A powerful Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, maintainable code.
- **Django REST Framework**: A flexible toolkit for building Web APIs, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Python**: The programming language behind the project, known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized to enhance user interactions and update the dashboard dynamically.
- **HTML**: Responsible for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS**: Used to style and layout the web application, providing an aesthetic user interface.
- **Pltly Charting Library**: Employed to generate interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs.

## Example

Using the Car Telematics App is straightforward. Upon accessing the application, users can navigate to the dashboard section to explore the telematics data. The dashboard showcases detailed information, including speed, RPM, fuel level, and temperature, allowing users to gain insights into vehicle performance.
